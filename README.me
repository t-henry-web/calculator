This project is to build a functional calculator with basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). 
The calculator should have a display, buttons for digits, operators, and a clear function. 
The goal is to practice JavaScript and HTML, focusing on DOM manipulation, functions, and handling basic user inputs.
